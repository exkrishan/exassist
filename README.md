# Agent Assist UI - Demo Application

This is a runnable React demo app that visually demonstrates an Agent Assist UI for voice and chat channels. It is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material UI v5. All data and real-time behaviors are simulated locally without any backend integrations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to Demo

The application is designed for a live product grooming or demo session. Here's a guide to showcasing its features:

### 1. The Layout

-   **Left Panel (`Interactions`):** Shows a static list of previous customer interactions, providing context.
-   **Center Panel (`Call`):** This is the agent's primary workspace. It shows call controls, customer information, a timeline, and a composer for notes.
-   **Right Panel (`Agent Assist`):** This is the core of the demo. It provides real-time assistance to the agent. It can be collapsed using the pin icon.

### 2. The Scenario Selector

Located at the top-left, the **Scenario Selector** dropdown is the main control for the demo. Each scenario simulates a different type of customer interaction and showcases different Agent Assist capabilities.

#### Recommended Demo Flow:

1.  **Start with "Incoming Call":**
    -   Select "Incoming Call" from the dropdown. The simulation will start automatically.
    -   Point out the call state changing from "Ringing" to "Connected".
    -   Watch the **Transcript** in the center panel update in real-time.
    -   Observe the **Agent Assist** panel on the right coming to life:
        -   An **Intent** is detected ("Reset PIN") with a high confidence score.
        -   **Default Questions** are shown for the agent to ask.
        -   Relevant **Knowledge Base (KB) Articles** are surfaced.
        -   A **Progressive Summary** begins to form with bullet points.
        -   The **Sentiment Bar** updates, reflecting the customer's mood.
    -   **Interact with KB Cards:**
        -   Click the `Insert` button on a KB card to copy its content into the "Notes" composer.
        -   Click the `Copy` button to simulate copying a link to the clipboard (a toast notification will appear).
        -   Click the thumbs-up/down buttons and show the feedback event appearing in the **Telemetry Console** at the bottom.
    -   When the call simulation ends, the **Disposition Modal** automatically appears, pre-filled with a suggested disposition and auto-generated notes. The agent can edit these and confirm.

2.  **Show "Low Confidence Intent":**
    -   Select this scenario.
    -   Highlight the **Intent Pill**, which now shows a "Low Confidence" badge and has a yellow color. This demonstrates how the UI alerts the agent when the system is not sure.
    -   Click the intent pill and use the "Search KB" button to manually find articles.

3.  **Show "KB No Results":**
    -   Select this scenario.
    -   The intent is detected, but the Assist panel shows a "No Knowledge Base articles found" message, demonstrating the fallback state.

4.  **Show "Chat Session":**
    -   This scenario simulates a text-based interaction, showing how the UI can be adapted for different channels.

### 3. Settings Panel

-   Click the settings cog icon in the top-right.
-   **Toggle Sentiment ON/OFF:** Show the sentiment bar disappearing.
-   **Toggle Progressive Summary ON/OFF:** Show the summary panel disappearing.
-   **Adjust Intent Confidence Threshold:** Lower the slider and re-run the "Low Confidence Intent" scenario. The intent will now appear as high-confidence, demonstrating configurability.

### 4. Telemetry Console

-   This panel at the bottom shows a live stream of events generated by the system and the agent's interactions (e.g., `assist_shown`, `assist_accepted`, `feedback_provided`). This is valuable for analytics and system improvement.

### 5. Responsiveness

-   Resize the browser window to be narrower than 900px.
-   The layout will stack into a single column, demonstrating its responsiveness for different screen sizes.
